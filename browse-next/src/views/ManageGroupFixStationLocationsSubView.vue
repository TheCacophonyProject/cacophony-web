  <h1>Fix group station locations</h1>
  <p>
    - Options for incorrectly located recordings are (and supported by future
    UI):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Where recording location is wrong - correct the location and assign
      automatically to (existing or new) station at the corrected location
    </li>
    <li>
      Where recording location is correct but station not the desired one -
      Manually reassign the recording to a specified existing station
    </li>
  </ul>
