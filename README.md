# cacophony-web
This is a mono-repo pulling together three older repositories: cacophony-api, cacophony-browse, and integration-tests

# cacophony-api

`cacophony-api` is a node server that is accessed through a RESTful API.  This allows uploading, processing and retrieving media collected for The Cacophony
Project.

## Instructions

Download and install the latest release from [Github](https://github.com/TheCacophonyProject/cacophony-web/releases).


## Development instructions

For development and testing purposes it is easiest to run
cacophony-api using Docker. To do this:

* Ensure your user account is set up to run commands as root using `sudo`.
* Ensure the Docker is installed (`sudo apt install docker.io` and docker-compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on
  Ubuntu)
* Run either `npm run dev` (if npm is installed) or `docker-compose build && docker-compose up --force-recreate`.

This will build and then run a Docker container which includes all the services needed to run the server.

Once the container is running, you can start a bash session inside
the container with `npm run dev:bash` or `docker-compose exec server bash`.

To start psql to query the database in base use the alias `psqltest`

#### Running the cypress tests

See [Cypress Tests](integration-tests/README.md) for details on running the cypress tests.

### API Documentation

API documentation can be generated by running `npm run apidoc`. The
resulting documentation ends up in the `apidoc` directory.

The API server also serves up the generated API documentation at it's
root URL.

### Database Migrations

These are run automatically when you start the server.

To create a new database migration file: `npm run new-migration <name>`

### Docker base image
To make the project build fast on our build servers (and your computer) we use a base docker image that contains nodejs, postgis, minio and most of our js dependencies.   The code for building this server is in the folder `docker-base`

### Releases
Releases are created using travis and git and saved [on Github](https://github.com/TheCacophonyProject/cacophony-web/releases).   Follow our [release instructions](https://docs.cacophony.org.nz/home/creating-releases) to create a new release.


# cacophony-browse

This is a web interface for querying with and interacting with Cacophony Project recordings using the project's API. It is based on the [Vue](https://vuejs.org) framework and uses [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org) for state management.


## Build Setup

``` bash
# enter browse package
cd browse

# install dependencies
npm install

# create config file
cp dev-config.js.TEMPLATE dev-config.js
# now edit the config file to point to correct API server

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for staging & production with minification
npm run release
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for
vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

# Development

Please follow the Vue style guide for all development:
https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/#ad

The project is configured to use eslint and prettier. Please ensure
your development setup included a recent version of prettier. Pull
requests will be checked to ensure there are no code formatting or
eslint issues.

To run eslint:
```
npm run lint
```

To run eslint and automatically fix issues:
```
npm run lint:fix
```

# Releases

* Ensure all changes have been merged and are pulled into the local copy.
* Tag the release (starting with a "v"), e.g.: `git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "1.2.3 release"`
* Push the tag to Github, e.g.: `git push origin v1.2.3`
* TravisCI will run the tests, create a release package and create a
  [Github Release](https://github.com/TheCacophonyProject/cacophony-web/releases)

## Web Server Configuration

The /srv/cacophony/cacophony-browse directory in the release package
should be served by a web server.

Sample configuration for the [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) web server:

```
# Update the host and port to match desired
http://localhost:9000 {
    gzip
    root  /srv/cacophony/cacophony-browse

    rewrite {
        ext !.jpg !.png !.svg !.js
        to /index-prod.html  # or index-staging.html
    }
}
```
Sample config for Nginx:
```
server {
    root /srv/cacophony/cacophony-browse;
    index index-prod.html;


    server_name browse.cacophony.org.nz;

    location / {
            try_files $uri $uri/ /index-prod.html;
    }
}
```
Note: you may also need to add a correct mime-type for WebAssembly (*.wasm)
